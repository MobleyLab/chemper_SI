# ChemPer Supporting Information 

This repository contains scripts using 
[`ChemPer`](https://github.com/MobleyLab/chemper)
to create `SMIRKS` patterns for a couple of example systems.
To test `ChemPer` we performed two different tests.
In the first, we generate `SMIRKS` which can reproduce 
the typing of smirnoff99Frosst on the simple AlkEthOH molecule set.
In the second test, we parameterize a polypeptide with 
the Amber99SB-ILDN protein force field and then try to generate 
SMIRKS which recreate this typing. 

Details and interpretations of these results 
are available in our preprint.
The sub-folder READMEs explain the scripts contained there.

# Other Fasta files

In the published test of ChemPer we used the "protein" with the sequence:

We can imagine repeating these tests with di- or tripeptides. 
This folder contains other fasta files we created when thinking about what to use when using ChemPer to create SMIRKS patterns. 
We did some minimal tests with these following the scripts used to create the SMIRKS for the single polypeptide. 
However, looping over more molecules was, in general, much slower so it became more efficient for testing to use a single polypeptide with all amino acids instead. 

These smaller polypeptides would serve as a good set to test any protein SMIRNOFFs to check that they are parameterized the same way wiht the reference force field.
